<h1>Todo-list</h1>

live: https://lezzen.github.io/todo-list/
<h2>Overview</h2>
This is a javascript project where I wanted to try a lot of new things that I had learned like webpack, css concepts like animations, positioning, media queries, javascript objects and module pattern. 


<h2>Features:</h2>

-Each todo has an edit, delete and more info icon.

-You can search a single todo or a group of todos that match a key word with the search bar.

-You can sort the todos by name, time and priority.

-In desktop, you can filter the todos with the sidebar and you can hide the sidebar if you wish.

-You can add "projects" which is your own custom category and of course filter the todos based on your project as well.

-The todos and projects are saved on localStorage so they're saved till you close the browser.
